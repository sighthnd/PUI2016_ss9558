For homework 3, I work in a group. The group includes Chunqing Xu, Jianghao Zhu, 	Franz Howell Loza, Le Xu and me. Everyone 
contributes to the whole homework.
I work on Assignment 1 (including the extra credit part) independently and I discuss with C.X. 
For assignemnt 2, J.Z brainstormed ideas regarding hypothesis with Le Xu and agreed with using age and gender to address nypothesis.
Franz focuses on the assignment 3. 
We fix the code and discuss statistics concepts (Z-statisitcs) together.
