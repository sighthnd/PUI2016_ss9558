I reviewed Yoshino Adriano Mitsuo's (amyoshino) citibike project.

a.
His idea is to test whether customers are less likely than subscribes to choose biking on weekdays. 
Adriano uses a ratio statistic to represent his hypothesis and I agree with him. 

In this case the null hypothesis should be "the ratio of subscribers biking on weekends over Subscribers biking on weekdays is the same or higher compared to the ratio of customers."

His Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly. 

b. 
Adriano chose usertype and date as his data to represent his hypothesis. He transformed usertype data into a dummy variable, which is great. 

The visualization is cool and the data supports the project. 

However, his figures does not have clear title so it is a little bit confusing compared to each other.

c. Given the type of data, I would choose a T test. 
The motivation to choose a T test is because we are looking at the difference between two groups, which are customers and subscribers.
