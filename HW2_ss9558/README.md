# PUI2016 HW2
Author: Siyang Sun

I worked on my own for assignment on #1,2 and 3.But I met some difficulities so I asked Chunqing Xu for help.
For Assign#1&2, I used the code
```python
if sys.version_info[0] == 3:
    from urllib.request import urlopen
else:
    from urllib import urlopen
```
to resolve the conflict between python 2 and 3. 

Assign#3 I asked him (and his group) how to directly access data through compute. I can not find the path at first.
The dataset I used in Assign #3 is the Natural Gas Consumption by ZIP code 2010. (uedp-fegm CSV)

I used the same dataset with C.X's group for the extra credit assignment.
