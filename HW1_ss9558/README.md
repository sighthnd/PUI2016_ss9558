# PUI 2016 HW 1.  

# Assignment 1: Finish the first lab and work with a fork

My neighbor in this assign is cx495. 
 I forked his repo “gitthubtest_cx495” and then cloned it as a local repo. I then made changes to my local copy, adding a line of code. After that, I committed my modified file and pushed the changes. I then requested a merge and accepted my neighbor’s pull request as well.

# Assignment 2: Set up your environment: 

1. I created a local directory named PUI2016_ss9558.
2. I created an environment variable PUI2016 so that typing “echo $PUI2016” returns the full path. 
	
3. I created an alias pui2016 so that typing it takes me to that directory.  
4. Screenshot of my .bashprofile

6. I created a new github repo and one on my local machine.
7. I created a directory HW1_ss9558
8. I added a README.md file to describe my homework 1.
