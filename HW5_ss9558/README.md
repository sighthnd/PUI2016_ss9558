## Assignment 3
### Experiment 1
Question: Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Design of Experiment: 
1. BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. In this experienment, I will use BMI to measure the fat loss. It would eliminate the effect on sexes, heights, weights and other factors that might effect the outcome. 
Diet: test group, Exercise: control group 
Null hypothesis: the average bmi change in the diet group (S0)is less than or equal to the average bmi change in the exercise group(S1). 
H0:S0<=S1
H1:S0>S1
