## Assignment 3
#### Set significance level $$ \alpha $$=0.05 for all experiments.
### Experiment 1
#### Question: Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?
Design of Experiment: 
1. BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. In this experienment, I will use BMI to measure the fat loss. It would eliminate the effect on sexes, heights, weights and other factors that might effect the outcome.

Diet: test group, Exercise: control group 

Null hypothesis: the average bmi change in the diet group (S0)is less than or equal to the average bmi change in the exercise group(S1). 

H0:S0<=S1

H1:S0>S1

$$ \alpha $$=0.05
### Experiment 2
#### Do American trust the president?
POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23). Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.
Null hypothesis: The proportion of public opinion of adults polled who trust the president is larger than or same to the proportion of public opinion of adults polled who don't trust the president, with a significant level=0.05.

H0:  P0[Proportion of public opinion of adults polled who trust the president]>=0.50

H1: P0[Proportion of public opinion of adults polled who trust the president] < 0.50

$$ \alpha $$=0.05
### Experiment 3
#### Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking.
Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.
Null hypothesis: nicotime patches to quit smokeing is not effective; the cesssation rates for smokers assigned to use a nicotine patch is lower than or equal to the rate in a placebo patch,with significance level p=0.05.

H0:S0[cessation rate of nicotine patch users] - S1[cessation rate of placebo patch group] <= 0

H1:S0[cessation rate of nicotine patch users] - S1[cessation rate of placebo patch group] > 0

$$ \alpha $$=0.05
### Experiment 4
#### Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.
Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.
Null hypothesis: The average IQ of chidren whose mothers smoke during pregnant (S_smoke)is higher or the same as whose mothers do not smoke during pregnant(S_not),with significance level p=0.05. 

H0:S_smoke >= S_not

H1:S_smoke < S_not
$$ \alpha $$=0.05
